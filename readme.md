# Twitter Pics Bot

[This bot](https://t.me/twitterpicsbot) can help you to index pictures from Twitter in Telegram. I know, I know, sounds weird but Telegram chat very good act like cloud storage!

# Commands

- `/info` - Get tweet info. (Creation date, user info, receiving media as files)
- `/privateon` - Enable private mode. (If enabled tweets that you send to bot will not be added to your usage history)
- `/privateoff` - Disable private mode.

Just send a bunch of tweets to the bot ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
